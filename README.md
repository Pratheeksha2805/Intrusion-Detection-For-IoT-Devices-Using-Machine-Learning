# Intrusion-Detection-For-IoT-Devices-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on enhancing the security of IoT 
devices by developing an intrusion detection system (IDS) using machine 
learning algorithms,that can identify and classify network traffic data as either 
normal or malicious. This is achieved through the implementation and 
comparison of various machine learning algorithms to perform binary and 
multi-class classification tasks,ultimately providing real-time threat detection 
and improving the overall security of IoT networks. 
This involved implementing and comparing various machine learning models to 
achieve high accuracy in both binary and multi-class classification tasks." 
Dataset: "The dataset used is  UNSW-NB15 dataset, which includes a mixture 
of normal and malicious network traffic data.which is specifically designed for 
network intrusion detection research. This dataset is widely recognized for its 
comprehensive representation of network traffic data, including both normal 
activities and various attack types. It contains around 2.5 million records, This 
dataset has around 49 features. 
Dataset includes nine different attack categories, such as: 
Fuzzers     Analysis    Backdoors    DoS (Denial of Service)    Exploits    Generic 
Reconnaissance     Shellcode     Worms
